# VanillaJSDrumKit

<p> This is a part of a 30-Day challenge I am doing to develop on <b>Vanilla JS</b> project everyday, for all 30 days. These projects are intended to be simple in that they use plain Javascript, CSS, and HTML ONLY. Each project goes over basic concepts every JavaScript Developer should new, and tricks they may have not. </p></hr>

<h3> To preview each project simply clone this repository.</h3></br>
<h3> Make sure to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"> Node.js </a> downloaded and ready to go so we can run a simple static server.</h3></br>
<h3> Run "static ." in terminal/command line.</h3></br>
<h3> Open localhost and you're ready! </h3></br>
